        <summary>Perfection in a bowl</summary>
        <p>Here's a recipe for a soup that must have frequently featured in one disguise or another in every single canteen and many households across the former Soviet empire: <strong>solyanka</strong>. A hearty soup originally from Russia and Ukraine that can be just as humble or elegant as you want. If you're a flashy Slav, you use seven types of meat (incl. kidneys) and throw in a handful of black olives, a slice of lemon and a generous pinch of capers. If you're a more modest Estonian, you stick to sweating onions and a choice of sausages. You can add cabbage or other vegetables, make a vegetarian, fishy or meaty solyanka.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
         <ul>
                <li>3 large onions (about 400 grams in total)</li>

                <li>100 grams of concentrated tomato puree</li>

                <li>3 salted cucumbers, halved lengthwise and sliced</li>
                <li>300-400 grams of cooked lean meat products (choose a mixture of Frankfurters, Polish kabanos or Krakow sausages, sliced cooked beef, mild chorizo sausages etc - 2-3 different types)</li>
                <li>To serve: sour cream or smetana or thick plain yogurt</li>
